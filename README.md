# Substitution-Cipher-Project
## Authors: Bryce VunCannon, Tommy Stuart, Josh Thompson


This repository contains python code that can **encrypt** or **decrypt** "*.txt" files based on user-input conditions.  
The following ciphers are implemented: substitution cipher, keyword substitution cipher, Caesar cipher, ROT-13 cipher, Atbash cipher, and the Affine cipher. 

# Josh Ideas:
add doctrings to all functions  
set parameter type, for example, shift: int  
ensure all code is commented properly  
test! try to break each function, fix them as needed
